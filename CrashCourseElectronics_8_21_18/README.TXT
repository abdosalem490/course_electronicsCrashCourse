README.TXT file for Crash Course Electronics by Andre' LaMothe

Welcome to Crash Course Electronics! In this ZIP file you will find all of the files referenced and required 
by the lectures during the course. Initially, I was going to copy files relevant to each lecture into that
lectures file set, but with over 130 lectures, that seemed like a bad idea. Rather, this single ZIP file contains
everything in a single container which is a much more organized approach. 

As the course grows over the months and years, any changes to the files will be reflected here, and a simple
dated file version appended to the master file name will indicate the latest version of the file. 

The current file as of 8.21.18 is:

CrashCourseElectronicsFiles_8_21_18.zip

The directory structure is as follows:
